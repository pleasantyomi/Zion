# Zion Assembly Church Of God, Nigeria

The need for this new website design arose as a result of a change in the church's logo and also a change in my development stack. The previous version was written mainly with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. But currently, I'm writing this new design mainly with reactjs and tailwindcss. 

The new design has fhe following features:

- Homepage
- Testimony page 
- Contact page 
- An events page 
- A blog page
